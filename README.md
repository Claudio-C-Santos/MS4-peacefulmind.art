This e-commerce platform was was designed and built in order to scale an already existing business. This business is the selling of handmade craft jewelry 
which has been running on Instagram using DMs to complete the sell. The intention is to automate most of the processes and allow the store owner to reach a bigger number of clients
and allow them to make their payments securely and hassle free via Stripe's payment system. With this platform up and running, the store owner only needs to monitor the orders and
post them itself. The platform requests the client to create an account in order to save their details and previous orders so make future purchases more efficient and easy for the client.
Besides the already crafted jewelry, the client has the option to make a custom order also through the platform. The client just needs to fill a form and include their requirements
for a custom made craft jewel.

Besides the business itself, on this platform there's a sub-platform called "Community" that has the goal of helping other small business to exposes themselves and hopefully reach
out to a bigger number of clients. This idea came from the very essence of "sharing is caring" that rules the store owner's life.
